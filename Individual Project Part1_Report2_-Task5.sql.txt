Compare the number of parking tickets purchased in the first month of this period of high active cases, to the number of parking #tickets purchased in the second month of this period of high active cases.
#Assumption: customers are aware of the high number of active cases and considering this when deciding how to travel to La Ronde.

#Objective: Quebec public health officials are investigating the impact that La Ronde had on the early stages of COVID-19 transmission in Quebec. To do so, they would like the names and contact #information of all the customers who visited La Ronde during the early stages of the spread of COVID-19 in Quebec so that they can compare them to the names of the individuals who they know tested #positive during this period. 

#Assumption: Let early stages of the spread of COVID-19 be when daily active cases were between 0 and 3000.

#Objective: Suppose that on days when the total active number of cases in Quebec is over 10,000, the government requires indoor capacity to be reduced by 20%. Show how many of La Rondeâ€™s facilities would #have had to reduce their capacity by 20% and then what their capacity would have become after the 20% reduction.

#Assumption: Facility capacity refers to the maximum number of people who can use the indoor part of a facility at one time.
